# Examples of Improved Explanations

## ‚ùå VAGUE Explanations (previous):
- "The sentence uses the relative clause correctly"
- "We use the Present Simple appropriately"
- "The correct form is X because it indicates an action"
- "The correct option is X because it uses Y correctly"

## ‚úÖ DETAILED Explanations (new):

### 1. Relative Clauses:
**Question:** "Identify the sentence that uses a relative clause correctly."

**Improved explanation:**
"The sentence <span style='color: #ff6b6b; font-weight: bold;'>The skills that he has learned are valuable</span> correctly uses a <span style='color: #74b9ff; border: 1px solid #74b9ff; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;'>restrictive relative clause</span>. We use <span style='color: #00b894; text-decoration: underline;'>'that'</span> instead of 'which' because we are identifying specific information about which skills are valuable. <span style='color: #fdcb6e; font-style: italic;'>Example: The book that I bought is interesting (not The book which I bought)</span>. The other options incorrectly use 'which' or 'who' for inanimate objects."

### 2. Present Perfect:
**Question:** "Which sentence best describes a skill improvement using the Present Perfect?"

**Improved explanation:**
"The phrase <span style='color: #ff6b6b; font-weight: bold;'>She has developed her leadership skills recently</span> correctly uses the <span style='color: #74b9ff; border: 1px solid #74b9ff; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;'>Present Perfect</span> to indicate an action completed in the past with <span style='color: #00b894; text-decoration: underline;'>present relevance</span>. <span style='color: #fdcb6e; font-style: italic;'>Example: I have finished my homework (present result: I am now free)</span>. The other options use Past Simple (completed action) or Present Simple (habit), which don't express the connection to the present."

### 3. Second Conditional:
**Question:** "Complete the sentence: 'If she ___ (have) more skills, she would find a better job.'"

**Improved explanation:**
"We use <span style='color: #ff6b6b; font-weight: bold;'>had</span> in the <span style='color: #74b9ff; border: 1px solid #74b9ff; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;'>Second Conditional</span> because the 'if' clause always uses the <span style='color: #00b894; text-decoration: underline;'>past simple</span> to express a hypothetical or unreal condition. <span style='color: #fdcb6e; font-style: italic;'>Structure: If + Past Simple, would + infinitive</span>. 'Has' is Present Perfect (reality) and 'have' is infinitive (not used in this position)."

### 4. Present Simple vs Present Continuous:
**Question:** "Choose the correct form: 'He ___ (work) on his skills every weekend.'"

**Improved explanation:**
"The correct form is <span style='color: #ff6b6b; font-weight: bold;'>works</span> because the <span style='color: #74b9ff; border: 1px solid #74b9ff; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;'>Present Simple</span> is used for <span style='color: #00b894; text-decoration: underline;'>habitual actions and routines</span>. <span style='color: #fdcb6e; font-style: italic;'>Example: I work every day, She studies on weekends</span>. 'Worked' is Past Simple (completed action) and 'is working' is Present Continuous (action in progress now), but here we're talking about a weekly routine."
