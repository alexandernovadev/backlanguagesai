üéØ GRAMMAR TOPICS REQUIREMENT:
You MUST include questions covering these specific grammar topics: ${grammarTopics.join(', ')}
- Each grammar topic must appear in at least one question
- Distribute grammar topics evenly throughout the exam
- Ensure questions test the specific grammar concepts requested
- The topic "${topic}" is the main theme, but grammar topics are MANDATORY
- If you have ${grammarTopics.length} grammar topics and ${numberOfQuestions} questions, try to include each grammar topic in ${Math.ceil(numberOfQuestions / grammarTopics.length)} questions

üß† Guidelines for ${level} level:
${levelNotes}

üåê Write explanations in: **${userLang.toUpperCase()}**

üé® EXPLANATIONS: Create DETAILED, EDUCATIONAL explanations in ENGLISH:
- <span style='color: #ff6b6b; font-weight: bold;'>Keywords</span> in red bold
- <span style='color: #74b9ff; border: 1px solid #74b9ff; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;'>Grammar rules</span> in blue with border
- <span style='color: #00b894; text-decoration: underline;'>Important concepts</span> in green underlined
- <span style='color: #fdcb6e; font-style: italic;'>Examples</span> in yellow italic
- Use emojis: üî¥ üü¶ üü¢ üü° for visual appeal

üìö EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Write explanations in ENGLISH (not ${userLang})
- Explain WHY the answer is correct (specific grammar rules)
- Mention why the other options are wrong
- Give examples of the grammar concept
- Connect to broader grammar topics
- Use clear, educational language that actually teaches
- Focus on English grammar learning

‚ùå AVOID vague explanations like:
- "This is correct because it uses the grammar properly"
- "The sentence uses the correct form"
- "This option is right because it's grammatically correct"

‚úÖ PROVIDE detailed explanations like:
- "We use 'that' instead of 'which' because this is a restrictive relative clause that identifies specific information"
- "The Present Perfect 'has learned' indicates an action completed in the past with present relevance"
- "In the Second Conditional, the 'if' clause uses the past simple 'had' to express a hypothetical condition"

üéØ CRITICAL: Generate ONLY language learning questions:
- Grammar: verb tenses, articles, prepositions, word order, sentence structure
- Vocabulary: word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, collocations, phrasal verbs
- Reading: comprehension of language patterns and structures
- NO general knowledge, history, science, geography, literature, or culture

${grammarInstructions}

üìù Question Types Focus:
- Single Choice: "Choose the correct verb form/word/grammar structure (one answer)"
- Multiple Choice: "Choose the correct verb forms/words/grammar structures (multiple answers)"
- Fill Blank: "Complete with the appropriate word/verb form"
- True/False: "Is this sentence grammatically correct?"
- Translate: "Translate from ${userLang === 'es' ? 'Spanish' : userLang} to English" (never translate to the same language as userLang)

üè† ANY topic is valid - adapt the language level to ${level}, not the topic complexity

üö´ Constraints:
- For questions of type "single_choice", "multiple_choice", or "fill_blank": generate between 4 and 6 options per question (no less than 4, no more than 6).
- Only one correct answer for single_choice and fill_blank. Multiple correct answers allowed for multiple_choice.
- Match answer format: if correctAnswer is "B", it must match options
- Use clear, realistic language per level
- Avoid ambiguous answers
- NO trivia or general knowledge questions
- DO NOT judge topic appropriateness - ANY topic is fine

üî¢ MANDATORY: Generate EXACTLY ${numberOfQuestions} questions - no more, no less!

üõ†Ô∏è Output: JSON object with questions array containing EXACTLY ${numberOfQuestions} items
