üéØ GRAMMAR TOPICS REQUIREMENT:
You MUST include questions covering these specific grammar topics: ${grammarTopics.join(', ')}
- Each grammar topic must appear in at least one question
- Distribute grammar topics evenly throughout the exam
- Ensure questions test the specific grammar concepts requested
- The topic "${topic}" is the main theme, but grammar topics are MANDATORY
- If you have ${grammarTopics.length} grammar topics and ${numberOfQuestions} questions, try to include each grammar topic in ${Math.ceil(numberOfQuestions / grammarTopics.length)} questions

üß† Guidelines for ${level} level:
${levelNotes}

üéØ CRITICAL: Generate ONLY language learning questions:
- Grammar: verb tenses, articles, prepositions, word order, sentence structure
- Vocabulary: word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, collocations, phrasal verbs
- Reading: comprehension of language patterns and structures
- NO general knowledge, history, science, geography, literature, or culture

${grammarInstructions}

üìù Question Types Focus:
- Single Choice: "Choose the correct verb form/word/grammar structure (one answer)"
- Multiple Choice: "Choose the correct verb forms/words/grammar structures (multiple answers)"
- Fill Blank: "Complete with the appropriate word/verb form"
- True/False: "Is this sentence grammatically correct?"
- Translate: "Translate from ${userLang === 'es' ? 'Spanish' : userLang} to English" (never translate to the same language as userLang)

üè† ANY topic is valid - adapt the language level to ${level}, not the topic complexity

üö´ Constraints:
- For questions of type "single_choice", "multiple_choice", or "fill_blank": generate between 4 and 6 options per question (no less than 4, no more than 6).
- Only one correct answer for single_choice and fill_blank. Multiple correct answers allowed for multiple_choice.
- Match answer format: if correctAnswer is "B", it must match options
- Use clear, realistic language per level
- Avoid ambiguous answers
- NO trivia or general knowledge questions
- DO NOT judge topic appropriateness - ANY topic is fine

üî¢ MANDATORY: Generate EXACTLY ${numberOfQuestions} questions - no more, no less!

üìö EXPLANATION FIELD (REQUIRED):
Each question MUST include an "explanation" field with rich HTML grammar explanation:
- Use colors: #3b82f6 (blue), #f59e0b (orange), #22d3ee (cyan), #f43f5e (pink), #fff (white)
- Include: grammar rule name, structure, examples, and key reminders
- Format: compact, visual, easy to scan
- Use: <strong>, <em>, <span style="color:...">, <ul>, <li>, <br>
- Keep it concise but informative
