ðŸŽ¯ SELECTED WORDS REQUIREMENT:
You MUST include these specific words naturally in the text: ${selectedWords.join(', ')}
- Use each word at least once in appropriate contexts
- Integrate them naturally into the narrative/story
- Do NOT create a separate vocabulary list or word bank
- Do NOT explain the meaning of these words
- These words should appear as part of the normal flow of the content
- Ensure the text feels natural while incorporating all selected words

ðŸŽ¯ GRAMMAR TOPICS REQUIREMENT:
Use these grammar patterns implicitly in the sentences: ${grammarTopics.join(', ')}
- Integrate them NATURALLY in the narrative/dialogue; do NOT name or explain the grammar
- NO headings, subtitles, or paragraphs that mention the grammar names
- NO meta explanations, definitions, or tutorials about grammar
- The topic "${prompt}" (or a random one) is the main theme; grammar is only reflected in how sentences are written
- Vary sentence structures so the selected grammar appears multiple times, but always as part of the story/content

          Generate a Markdown text in language "${language}" according to ISO 639-1 standards for languages. 
          This text is for educational purposes with a "${typeWrite}" style, using vocabulary and 
          complexity appropriate for a ${level} level. 

          Formatting guidelines:
          - Title should be "# Title".
          - Use one main subtitle as "## Subtitle".
          - Use additional subtitles as "### Subtitle" if needed.
          - Avoid using additional H1 or H2 headers after the initial title and subtitle.
          - Don't use h4 or h5 or h6 headers.
          - Don't use old fashioned words
          - Don't use nested lists (sub-lists) in the Markdown.

          Content guidelines:
          - Avoid using rare, uncommon words or special symbols, as each word should be clickable and easily searchable in a dictionary.
          - For ${level} level:
            - **A1-A2:** Use simple words, basic sentences, and give short, clear examples. Define complex words as needed.
            - **B1-B2:** Use intermediate vocabulary, compound sentences, and provide real-world examples.
            - **C1-C2:** Use advanced vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and offer deeper analysis or insights.
          - Include quotes or examples to enrich the content where relevant.
          - If grammar topics are provided, REFLECT them only through sentence construction. Do NOT mention or explain grammar topics explicitly.
          ${promptWords}

          - Length MUST BE between ${rangeMin} and ${rangeMax} characters.
          - Must make a subtitle and not just put "subtitle" or "subtitle 1" or "subtitle 2".
    
          Learning aids:
          - For C1-C2 levels, include a brief summary of the main points.
