🎯 SELECTED WORDS REQUIREMENT:
You MUST include these specific words naturally in the text: ${selectedWords.join(', ')}
- Use each word at least once in appropriate contexts
- Integrate them naturally into the narrative/story
- Do NOT create a separate vocabulary list or word bank
- Do NOT explain the meaning of these words
- These words should appear as part of the normal flow of the content
- Ensure the text feels natural while incorporating all selected words

🎯 GRAMMAR TOPICS REQUIREMENT:
Use these grammar patterns implicitly in the sentences: ${grammarTopics.join(', ')}
- Integrate them NATURALLY in the narrative/dialogue; do NOT name or explain the grammar
- NO headings, subtitles, or paragraphs that mention the grammar names
- NO meta explanations, definitions, or tutorials about grammar
- The topic "${prompt || 'random'}" is the main theme; grammar is only reflected in how sentences are written
- Vary sentence structures so the selected grammar appears multiple times, but always as part of the story/content

Generate a Markdown text in language "${language}" according to ISO 639-1 standards for languages. 
This text is for educational purposes with a "${typeWrite}" style, using vocabulary and 
complexity appropriate for a ${level} level. 

CRITICAL - Vocabulary:
- ALWAYS use everyday, common vocabulary regardless of level. Never use rare, archaic, or overly formal words.
- Complexity comes from grammar and sentence structure, NOT from obscure vocabulary.
- Each word should be clickable and easily searchable in a dictionary.

Formatting guidelines:
- Title must be "# Title".
- Use one main subtitle as "## Subtitle".
- Use additional subtitles as "### Subtitle" frequently (every 2-3 paragraphs) for clear structure.
- You can use h4 (####) and h5 (#####) headers for sub-sections.
- Avoid using additional H1 or H2 headers after the initial title and subtitle.
- Don't use old fashioned words.
- Don't use nested lists (sub-lists) in the Markdown.

Rich markdown formatting:
- Use **bold** generously to highlight key vocabulary, important concepts, and punchy phrases (2-4 per paragraph).
- Use *italic* for emphasis, emotions, or to draw attention to specific words.
- Use blockquotes (>) for dialogue, memorable quotes, or key takeaways.
- Vary paragraph length—mix short impactful sentences with longer descriptive ones.
- Make the text visually rich and engaging with clear visual hierarchy.

Content guidelines:
- For ${level} level:
  - **A1-A2:** Use simple words, basic sentences, and give short, clear examples. Define complex words as needed.
  - **B1-B2:** Use intermediate vocabulary, compound sentences, and provide real-world examples.
  - **C1-C2:** Use everyday, common English vocabulary (same as A1-B2). Only increase complexity through grammar, sentence structure, and nuance—never through rare or fancy words. Deeper analysis but with simple, accessible words.
- Include quotes or examples to enrich the content where relevant.
- If grammar topics are provided, REFLECT them only through sentence construction. Do NOT mention or explain grammar topics explicitly.
${promptWords ? `Include these easy words: ${promptWords}` : ""}
- CRITICAL: Do NOT end the text with conclusions, closing phrases, or summary statements.
- CRITICAL: Do NOT use phrases like "in conclusion", "to conclude", "in summary", "to finalize", "para finalizar", "en conclusión", "para concluir", or any similar closing phrases.
- The text should end naturally with the content itself, without explicit conclusions or endings.

- Length MUST BE between ${rangeMin || 200} and ${rangeMax || 400} WORDS (not characters).
- CRITICAL: The text must have AT LEAST ${rangeMin || 200} words. Count the words carefully.
- CRITICAL: Do NOT stop generating until you reach the minimum word count of ${rangeMin || 200} words.
- Must make a subtitle and not just put "subtitle" or "subtitle 1" or "subtitle 2".

Learning aids:
- For C1-C2 levels, include a brief summary of the main points.
